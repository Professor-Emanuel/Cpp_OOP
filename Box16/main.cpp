    The reason for the incorrect output is that the call of the function volume()
    is being set once by the compiler as the version defined in the base class.
    This is called static resolution of the function call, or static linkage -
    the function call is fixed before the program is executed. This is also sometimes
    called early binding because the volume() function is set during the compilation of the program.

    But now, let's make a slight modification in our program and precede the declaration
    of volume() in the Box class with the keyword virtual

    After this slight modification, when the previous example code is compiled and executed,
    it produces the following result âˆ’

    Cube class volume:
    Parallelepiped class volume:
    */

    /*
    This time, the compiler looks at the contents of the pointer
    instead of it's type. Hence, since addresses of objects
    of cube and par classes are stored in *box the respective
    volume() function is called.

    As you can see, each of the child classes has a separate
    implementation for the function volume(). This is how
    polymorphism is generally used. You have different
    classes with a function of the same name, and even the
    same parameters, but with different implementations.
